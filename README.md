    Verify that the tables and data have been created successfully.
2. Run the Backend:
    Open the backend project in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
    Ensure your application.properties or application.yml is configured with the correct database credentials.
    Start the Spring Boot application and confirm that the local server is running (typically on http://localhost:8080).
3. Run the Frontend (Android App):
